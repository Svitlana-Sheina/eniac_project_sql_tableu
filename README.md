# eniac_project_sql_tableu

🎯 Project Overview

This project explores whether Magist, a Brazilian e-commerce platform, is a suitable partner for selling high-end tech products. Using SQL-based data analysis, we investigated product categories, seller performance, delivery times, and market conditions. The results indicate that Magist is not an ideal partner due to its limited tech focus, long delivery times, and relatively low customer satisfaction.

📊 Dataset & Sources

Source: Public Magist e-commerce dataset (used in data bootcamps and analytics challenges)

Size: ~99,000 orders, 3,000+ sellers, 70+ product categories

Features: Orders, products, sellers, payments, delivery performance, customer reviews

Preprocessing: SQL queries to clean, aggregate, and join tables for business insights

🚀 Key Findings & Results

Tech products represent only ~7% of Magist’s sales

Average delivery time is ~12 days, with 10% of orders delayed

Every 5th review of tech products is negative, even when counting 4–5 stars as positive

Apple’s market share in Brazil (~13%) is far lower than in Europe (~34%)

Magist is strategically unsuitable for premium Apple/iOS expansion

Business Recommendation: Brazil is not a favourable market for Apple products. Focus expansion on other markets with higher iOS adoption and seek partners with stronger tech expertise, faster logistics, and higher customer satisfaction.

🛠️ Technologies Used

SQL (MySQL / Workbench)

Data Analysis Tools: Tableau (for visualisations)
